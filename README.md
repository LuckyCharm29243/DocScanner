# DocScanner
Simplest, most basic document scanner for iOS.

> [!CAUTION]
> This app will quit when it's sent to background. The scanned document will be lost unless already shared or saved someplace else. To disable this, set `UIApplicationExitsOnSuspend` to NO / `false` or remove the key entirely, then recompile.
